            Hello, my name is Chance Abenes.
            </p>
            
           
          
            <p class="tab">     I am a University of North Florida graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computing and Information Sciences. I have experience in many different computing languages and platforms including work with Java, HTML, CSS, MySQL, AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, 
                Express.js, Node.js, and React which this web application is built upon. I also have experience working with JIRA and GitHub to coordinate software
                development progress. 
                </p>
                <p class="tab">  
                For a whole year my team and I at UNF worked with Doctor Sherif Elfayoumy to develop an application for future students of the college
                that would allow them to enroll in a newly created program. This application would allow students to document hours within the program and Doctor Elfayoumy 
                would be able to collect and archive this data for processing and awarding these hours collected. As the Technical Writer, I was mostly responsible for documenting
                all user stories and requirements as well as any and all documentation that was required for the project including user manuals etc.. 
                I was also an appointed developer/project manager, responsible for the Administrator side of the application that allowed Doctor Elfayoumy 
                to navigate all data submitted to the system.
            </p>

            <p class="tab">
                After the completion of my degree with UNF, I have taken an interest in data analysis. Now, I have a newfound passion to become a data analyst
                within the healthcare field so that I may help patients and hospitals in need with the power of data. After working in the industry for a few years
                I hope to return to school and finish my master's degree and advance my education in hopes of becoming a data scientist. Possibly continuing my work within 
                the healthcare industry or working with some of my favorite gaming companies to help coordinate ambitious video game projects.
